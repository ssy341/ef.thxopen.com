                            <p>
                                a unit of language, consisting of one or more spoken sounds or their
                                written representation, that functions as a principal carrier of meaning.
                                Words are composed of one or more morphemes and are either the smallest
                                units susceptible of independent use or consist of two or three such units
                                combined under certain linking conditions, as with the loss of primary accent
                                that distinguishes black·bird· from black· bird·. Words are usually separated
                                by spaces in writing, and are distinguished phonologically, as by accent, in many languages.
