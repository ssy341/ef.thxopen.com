I had a lot of dreams when I was a child. I wanted to be a scientist, a teacher, a doctor, or a police. 
I really wanted to be a scientist. I thought this job was very interesting and exciting. 

<!--more-->

I thought scientists could create many useful things which could help us improve life quality. 
I thought that was amazing and fantastic.
 
 Well, when I grew up, I knew that was not real for me.
 So let's forgot these stupid dreams. Wow, don't I have a dream? No, dream is just not real for me. 
 I need to make the dream more real. Like choosing a goal, making a plan and doing it. 
 
 So, then I have an idea. I just want to study English well first.
  Why? Because English is an international language. If I can speak English, 
  I can communicate with more people and learn more knowledges.
   
   Certainly learning English is 
  just one of my goals. Rome was not built in one day. I believe that with my all goals 
  I can be closer to success and closer to my dream.
