My name is Shan siyi, my English name is Keith, 
I'm 25 years old, I come from Changde in Hunan. 
Now I live in Chengdu. I am a computer programmer.

"All things are difficult before they are easy".

I always remember the experience that fixing computer cost me 200RMB,and I decided that I would earn the money back.


When I was in high school,I knew a master and i got some skills from him.

When I was in university, I chose software project major.

When I graduated, I engaged in three jobs which were relevant(related) to my major.

It cannot stop, and I have been worked on IT for almost 10 years.

Anyway, it is a perfect thing that I can persist on one thing for ten years.


Now,I really comprehend it that the interest is the best teacher.

Since I graduated,I found everything was not simple.

Everyone is always changeable, the relationship between people is not simple.

Asking for help is not easy. What should I do?

God saves（helps） the people who save（help） themselves. The only thing we can do is to improve our abilities then solve the problems by ourselves
I had been in CS for 5 years ,then I went to GZ for half an year. Now I am in CD.During these years I have experienced more and felt a lot.

I usually use English in my job.

For example,Java,a programme language,makes a program based on sepcial words.


It's right, that is my job.

Although people don't understand English ,they can type codes,but I don't think so.




The computer is more and more popular in China,but it has originated in U.S.A


some  first-hand materials of new technology are in English, but  it has become very popular after they are in Chinese，
which we can not grasp the opportunity.

The IT technology is updated so fast,so we need to keep on learning new things



If you don't wanna follow other people,you need to make yourself stronger.


Then/therefore/thus/so, if I improve my English ,I can understand the English website,so, this is why I 
came to EF.


You will never know if you never even try.

I made up my mind to study in EF in Otc. 2015.


For the past one year, I am up to level 5, Elementary , and I think I have changed a lot.


First,I became more confident.



Then ,I can speak to people in English,although they are simple sentences.



These are my biggest differences.




We learn English in school for a long time, but we still can't speak English after work.
We always say"How are you?I'm fine, thank you.".


I have been so happy in EF,I make so many friends here , including three foreign teachers,C,D,and T,and they are friendly. 


Previously, I was afraid of speaking when I saw the foreigners(foreign guys), I just nodded to them,which meant saying hello.


Now ,it is different ,I can communicate with them in some simple conversations.

     
If I make mistakes,teachers will correct them.


sometimes,teachers will teach me some native expressions ,which makes me feel good.


EF's core is Learn-Try-Apply.
首先是学习，通过线上的学习系统地将单词、语法、句型输入到大脑；
First, systematic learn words,grammar and sentence from Smart. 
接着是尝试，通过线下外教上课，巩固线上知识并加以运用；
Then, have a class to rebuild and use the knowleage on offline. 
最后是应用，通过参加life club，自己开口说英语，在不同的环境场合下练习英语。
Finally,join in Life Club，spoken by yourself in difference environment.
同时线上系统还提供了在线小组会话，一周7个话题，让自己在家里也能得到口语的练习；
At the same time,the Smart provide online workshop，it has 7 topic per week，you can practice spoken anywhere.
还有20分钟的私人会话课程，这个课程是一对一的，
And the Smart provide 20 minutes private lesson,one to one,
你可以使用这个课程来复习你学习过的线上单元，也可以把平时遇到的问题提出来，让老师解答。
You can review or ask some questions in this lesson.
一年的学习，让我受益匪浅.
I learn more from EF for one year.
我发现只是能阅读懂英文还是不够的，口语才是最重要的，如果不能表达，那学得再好又有什么用呢？
I found that just can read English is not enough,oral English is the important.If you don't speak, learning English is useless
回想起学校的学习方式，只是单纯的学习，没有得到充分地口语练习，久而久之就会慢慢遗忘。
The way of learning is too simple in school，and we practice oral English not enough。So we will forget how to use。 
虽然现在是花钱去学习，但是既然选择了，那么就好好学下去。
Now, i pay for learning English,but I already choose this way,I need to keep going.

“坚持才会胜利”。
Success Belongs to the Persevering
不积跬步无以至千里，不积小流无以成江海。
No accumulation of steps,can't lead to thousand miles.No integration of streams,can't result in seas and oceans.
语言的学习也是如此，不能一蹴而就。
Learning English is continual long-time progress.
我在中心不是学的最好的，我读书的时候成绩一直是倒数，所以学习对我来说是一件比较困难的事情。
I am not best in the EF center.When I in school,my study is too bad. So study is to hard for me.
但是在这里不一样，自己想学和别人让你去学，感觉是不一样的。
But here is different, you want to learn and let you learn feeling is not same.
所谓兴趣是最好的老师，这句话能解释这一切。
Interesting is the best teacher,it can explain all.
最大的敌人莫过于自己，要想超越别人，首先得超越自己。
The strongest enemy is yourself,if you want to beat others,you should beat yourself first.
首先制定一些计划，每完成一个阶段的计划，进行前后对比，哪里是之前不懂的，现在懂了，或者和外教交流找出自己未发觉的错误。
First，you need make a plan,and when you finished,compare it. what you learn, what you don't understand.Or make a conversation with teacher to find some mistakes.
其次是自己上课的笔记以及线上单元的知识点和视频，需要来回的查阅复习，温故而知新，
Then,you must review note and vedio of online.
只有这样不断的复习，把知识慢慢输入到大脑中并加以应用，这样学到的东西才能牢记于心。
Only over and over review ,you can rememeber it easily.
最后在中心可以和朋友用英语讨论简单的话题，相互交流学习经验，或者把自己学习到的新东西分享给别人。
Finally,you can make a simple topic with friend,talk  to each other and share what you learn.
有研究证明，一个东西出现在7个不同的场景，你就会记住它。你在分享给别人的同时，你自己也进行了复习。  
There is a proof ,if word display in 7 different situations，you can remember it. You are sharing while you are reviewing. 
  
学习是一个过程，一两天是看不出变化的，
Studying English is progress,it isn't has change for short time.
所以每天都应该花些时间在英语上，时间久了，自己就发现变化了，
so you should study everyday to enrich your knowledge
哪怕每天只记一个单词。
even though you just remember one word every day.
当然这里说的记一个单词不是简单的能读能写，或者记住意思，
of course, remember word isn't can read, write or remember what it means
更多的是在句子中的含义，同一个单词在不同的句子中，甚至是同一个句子都可以有不同的含义。
the most of means is you need understand the word have different mean in different sentence.
所以在记单词的同时结合相应的例句那是再好不过了。 
So，remember the word by sentence is the best way。   
    
Study is yourself business，you can't depend on other people，you juet believe yourself，and remember one thing that all of thing just for fun，it‘s not a burden
and you will success
