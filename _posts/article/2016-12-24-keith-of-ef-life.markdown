### All things are difficult before they are easy

There is an old saying，"All things are difficult before they are easy". I always remember the experience that fixing computer cost me 200RMB,and I decided that I would earn the money back.
When I was in high school,I knew a master and i got some skills from him. When I was in university, I chose software project major. When I graduated, I engaged in three jobs which were related to my major.

It cannot stop, and I have been working on IT for almost 10 years. Anyway, it is a perfect thing that I can persist on one thing for ten years. Now,I really comprehend it that the interest is the best teacher.

Since I graduated,I found everything was not simple. Everyone is always changeable, the relationship between people is not simple. Asking for help is not easy. What should I do? God saves（helps） the people who save（help） themselves. 
The only thing we can do is to improve our abilities then solve the problems by ourselves. 

I had been in Changsha for 5 years ,then I went to Guangzhou for half a year. Now I am in Chengdu. During these years I have experienced so much and grown a lot. 

I usually use English in my job. For example, Java, a programme language, makes a program based on sepcial words. It's right, that is my job. 

Although people don't understand English, they can type codes, but I don't think so. The computer is more and more popular in China, but it has originated in U.S.A. Some first-hand materials of new technology are in English, and it has become very popular after they are in Chinese，
which means we can not grasp the opportunity. The IT technology is updated so fast that we need to keep on learning new things. If you don't wanna follow other people, you need to make yourself stronger.

Therefore, if I improved my English, I would understand the English website, that's why I came to EF.


### You will never know if you never even try.

You will never know if you never even try. I made up my mind to study in EF in Otc. 2015. For the past one year, I am up to level 5, Elementary, and I think I have changed a lot.

First,I became more confident. Then, I can speak to people in English, although they are simple sentences. These are my biggest improvements. 

We learn English at school for a long time, but we still can't speak English after work. We always say "How are you? I'm fine, thank you, and you? ".

I have been so happy in EF, because I can make so many friends here, including three foreign teachers, Clark, Daniel, and Tommy, and they are friendly.

This is Clark, very tall(197) ……

{% include 4u.html src="images/teacher/Daniel.JPG" %}
This is Daniel, very kind

{% include 4u.html src="images/teacher/Tommy.JPG" %}
The people with taking picture is Tommy, he is very funny

Previously, I was afraid of speaking when I saw the foreigners, I just gave them a node, which meant saying hello. Now, it is different and I can communicate with them in some simple conversations.
If I made mistakes,teachers will correct them. Sometimes, teachers will teach me some native expressions, which makes me feel good.

### Learn Try Apply

{% include 4u.html src="images/learn try apply.png" %}

EF's core is Learn-Try-Apply. 

 - First, systematically learn words, grammar and sentence from Smart System 
 - Then, take a class to rebuild and use the knowleage on offline 
 - Finally, join in Life Club and speak English in difference ways in real environments with classmates and teachers to practice

At the same time, the Smart provides online group lessons which has 7 topics per week, in this way you can practice speaking anywhere and anytime.
Furthermore, the Smart provides 20 minutes private lesson, you can make full use of it to practice your own English one to one.
Here you can review or ask some questions you have no idea recently in this lesson.

I have been learning English at EF for one year, which brings me a lot! I found that oral English takes an more important part than just know the language kept in mind.
If you don’t use the language to communicate, so what's the purpose of it? I realized that the way of learning is too simple at school, and our practicing of oral English isn't enough for communication.
So we will forget how to use it easily! 
 
### Roman can't be built in one day
 
Now, I pay for learning English, but I've already choose this way, I need to insist on it! 

Learning English is continual long-time progress. As the old saying goes, Roman can't be built in one day! When I was at school, my study was too bad. So study is a bit hard for me. 
What is different here is that interest let me shift from passive learning to active leaning. This means that interest is the best teacher which gives me a lot of motivation. 

The strongest enemy is yourself. If you want to beat others, you should beat yourself first. 

As below, First, you need to make a plan, and compare it with what you did before and what you understand so fa or make a conversation with teacher to find some mistakes.
Then,you must review the notes you took in the classes and the vedio of online. Only with over and over review, you can remember it efficiently. 
Finally,you can often chose a simple topic to talk with your friends at the center.

There is a proof, if a word is displayed in 7 different situations，you can remember it. Furthermore, you are reviewing while you are sharing. 


### Just do it

Studying English is a long-time process, it cannot make obvious changes in a short time. So it's really efficient to study everyday to enrich your knowledge.
Even though just one word per day! Of course, remembering a word doesn't mean you just can read, write or remember what it means.
The most of meaning is that you need to understand the word has different meanings in different sentences. So there is nothing better than to remember a word with enough examples!

Studying is your own business, so you can't depend on other people. You can only believe yourself，and one more thing is that all of thing are just for fun, it's s not a burden.

Finally, just do it, you will be successful!
