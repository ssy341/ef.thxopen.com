## Fix it
Now, I don't **have work**. But I still get up at 7 o'clock. I go running at 7:30 and I eat breakfast at 8 o'clock. 
I usually **read** at 10 o'clock. I often go to **the EF center** at afternoon. In the evening, I **watch movies** and 
listen to music to relax. Next time, I will **code** for a while for my favorite moment. I go to bed at 11 o'clock. 
What a beautiful day!

## Reference:

Hello! My name is Kim. My day is very busy. I get up at 6 o'clock in the morning. I take a train to work. 
I have a lot of meetings. I usually go home at 7 in the evening.


## Teacher comment:

- Missing word (MW): When you were talking about 'your daily schedule,', I noticed that you missed out a word in one of 
the sentences 'to EF center'. In English, we use articles (a, an, the) before a noun. 
Remember to use the definite article 'the' before singular and plural nouns when the noun is specific or particular. 
Example: 'to the EF center.' 

- Word Choice (WC): When you talked about 'your daily schedule,' I noticed that you did not use the correct words 
in one of the sentences 'watching movie.' Remember to use a dictionary to get the correct word or words to suit the situation. 
Example: Instead of saying 'watching movie,' you should have said 'watch movies.' 

We look forward to receiving your next writing submission. Overall you did a good job!!

## Summary

- 如果是带有特指的时候，在名词前面加 the
- 描述经常发生的事情，用一般现在时  In the evening, I watch movies and listen to music to relax.
