## My answer is:

Most people in my country love playing basketball. Ping Pong and badminton are popular, too. 
In summer, many people like going swimming. In winter, few people like playing ice hockey.  

## Fix it
Most people in my country love playing basketball. Ping Pong and badminton are popular, too. 
In **the** summer, many people **like  swimming**. In **the** winter, few people like playing ice hockey. 

## Reference:

Most people in my country love watching football and basketball. In the winter, many people go ice skating and skiing. 
In the summer, people like playing tennis and golf. Having a picnic, going on hikes and swimming are popular, too.

## Teacher comment:

- Missing Word (MW) - I noticed that you didn't use a word to complete your description. 
'In winter, few people like playing ice hockey'. You can use the article 'the' to connect the 
ideas in your sentence and make it grammatically correct. Instead of saying 'In the winter, few people like playing ice hockey 

- Delete (DD) - Reading your submission, I noticed that you used a word that was not necessary. 
Instead of saying 'In summer, many people like going swimming' you should have said 'In the summer, many people like swimming'
