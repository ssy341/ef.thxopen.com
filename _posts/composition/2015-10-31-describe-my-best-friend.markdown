## My answer is:

Cheng Ming is my best friend.He lives in Changsha.He is a manager.He is very hardworking.And he is friendly and kindly,
so he always smiles.He like help each other.And he is married.His wife is beautiful and lovely.

## Fix it

Cheng Ming is my best friend. He lives in Changsha. He is a manager. He is very hardworking. 
And he is friendly and kindly, so he always smiles. He **likes to** help each other. **However**, he is married. 
His wife is beautiful and lovely.

## Reference:

My boss is very nice. He's from Beijing, China. He's very tall and has short black hair. 
He is very hardworking, but very friendly. He always smiles.

## Teacher comment:
Agreement: In this sentence, I have changed the agreement 'like' into 'likes'. 
Kindly note that, in simple present tense, if the subject is the third person singular, 
the verb form should be 'verb+ 's' or 'es'. Here, 'he' is the third person singular, 
so we should give 'es' or 's'. before you used " He like to help each other." 
and now I changed "He likes to help each other.., e.g.,"He likes to help each other." 
Preposition: In this sentence, I have inserted the preposition 'to'. When two verbs follow each other in a sentence, 
we call the second verb a verb complement. The complement may be one of three things: an infinitive, a gerund or the root 
of the verb. Hence, I have inserted 'to' in this sentence. e.g.," He likes to help each other."

## Summary

- 注意单复数，He 是第三人称，后面的动词需要加s或者es
- 一个句子里不能出现两个动词，在like后面接动名词或者是不定式，I like studing English.
