## My answer is:

You are really a food lover. I know a good restaurant, it is on the corner of  third street. 
I like their sandwiches and salads. And I love their desserts. They‘re always really fresh. 
The spicy food is very delicious. 

## Fix it

**If you** are really a food lover. I know a good restaurant, it is on the corner of  **Third** Street. 
I like their sandwiches and salads. And I love their desserts. They‘re always really fresh. 
The spicy food is very delicious.

## Reference:

The Fish House has delicious food, and their lunch is not expensive. I really like the fresh fish and salads. 
The hamburgers are really good, too. Their chocolate cake is awful, but the ice cream isn't bad.

## Teacher comment:

- 1. Missing Word: If you are really a food lover. You have written the sentence ''You are really a food lover''.
  The meaning of the sentence becomes complete after inserting the missing word. Here the missing word 
  is "if" which is added to the sentence.The correct sentence is "If you are really a food lover. ". 
- 2. Capitalization: it is on the corner of Third Street.	Always capitalize proper nouns.

## Summary

- If you are really a food lover.
- 特有名词首字母大写，the Third street
