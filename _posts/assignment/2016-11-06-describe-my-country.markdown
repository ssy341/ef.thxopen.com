## Fix it

I live in Chengdu, China. **It is** a great place. There are some historic attractions. For example Jinli and Wuhou temple. 
There **is** also some delicious food. I **especially** like ChuanChuan. It's spicy but I love it.
There is a kind of cute animal. **It's called a panda with white and black fur.** 
**Panda is an endangered species protected in China.**

## Reference:

My name is Cody. I live in Nome, Alaska. Alaska is the biggest state in the United States. We have incredible nature in my state. 
There are a lot of forests and mountains. Mount McKinley is the highest mountain in North America. I'd suggest you hike Mount McKinley. 
I often see grizzly bears, wolves and deer. Don't go hiking alone.

## Teacher comment:

- Word Choice(WC): Please pay attention to word choice and make sure that you use the correct words in the right situations to express your ideas. 
  You said ''Panda is the highest level be protected in China." rather say ''Panda is an endangered species protected in China.".
   
- Non verb agreement (AG): When you were talking about Example, I noticed that you used the verb “are“ in the sentence, 
  “There are also some delicious food”. We use the verb “is” with singular nouns and we use the verb “are“ with plural nouns. 
   Rather say “There is also some delicious food.”.

## Summary

- 使用is描述单数名词，使用are描述复数名词。
