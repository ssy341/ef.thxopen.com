## My answer is:

July 9,
Dear Bob,
Thanks so much for lunch today. I really enjoyed myself. The fired noodles was really good. 
It is taste just a little briny. I think put less salt then will be perfect. Anyway, thank you so much. 
I hope that I can cook lunch for you next time.

Thank again!
Sincerely,
Keith

Dear Bob,
Thanks so much for lunch today. I really enjoyed myself. The fired noodles **were** really good. 
It **tasted** just a little briny. I think **if they put less salt**, then will be perfect. 
Anyway, thank you so much. I hope that I can cook lunch for you next time.

**Thanks** again!
Sincerely,

## Reference:

Dear Clay,
I had a great time at the party last night. Thanks so much for inviting me. Your friends are really nice. I hope that we meet again soon. Thanks again.
Sincerely,
Karen

## Teacher comment:

- VERB TENSE: We say "noodles were" because plural verbs go with plural nouns. 

- WORD CHOICE: When we use "thanks" as a noun, it's always plural.
