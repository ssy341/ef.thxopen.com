## My answer is:

In the office,there are a few chairs and a few desks.
There are some plants ,some computers ,some keyboards and some mouses on the desk,
and tow trashs on the floor.

## Reference:

In my office, there are a lot of people. There are some desks, 
some computers and some chairs. There is a kitchen, a meeting room, 
a few restrooms and a lot of windows.

## Teacher comment:

1. Please take care with your punctuation and remember to leave a space AFTER all punctuation (. , ! ? etc). 
2. Subject-Verb Agreement: The subject and the verb must agree in number. The plural verb "are" agrees with the plural subject "chairs"............."there are a few chairs and a few desks."


## Summary

这是我来英孚写的第一篇作文，作文很简单，但是还是出了错误。大家有没有看出来呢？原来在英语的书写中， **每个标点符号后要有一个空格** ，这里和中文不一样。大家知道了么？
