You should going to a movie. And how about play cards game with your friend?

## Fix it

Hi friends,
**The weather is bad. I'm sorry you're bored. **
You should **go for a movie**. And how about **play a card game** with your friend? 
Maybe you should go to a restaurant for **some delicious food**.
Have fun!
Keith

## Reference:

Sorry about the weather, but you're on vacation! You should go shopping. You can go for a walk in the park. 
How about a movie? There are many good movies now. What about a museum? I love museums. Have fun!

## Teacher comment:

- Word Choice (WC)- Choice of words is an important thing to remember while writing so that you will convey what you are 
trying to say clearly. Example: 'boring' replaced with 'bored'. 

- Missing Word (MW) - Missing words are important because they make the sentence more meaningful. Example: 'some'.


## Summary

- 描述人的感受+ed，描述事情的感觉+ing  That is boring. I am so bored.
- 加上一些单词描述，使句子更有意义 some delicious food
