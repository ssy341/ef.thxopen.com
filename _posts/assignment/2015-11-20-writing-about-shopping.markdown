## My answer is:

I'm a boy, so I less go to department stores. I usually shop online, and buy something about computer. 
Because I'm a programmer. But I have a elder sister. Almost all of the clothes were bought for my elder  sister. 
I love my elder sister very much ,and she loves me too.

## Fix it

I'm a boy, so I **very seldom** go to department stores. I usually shop online, and buy **computer electronics** 
because I'm a programmer. But I have **an** elder sister **and almost** all of the clothes **I bought were bought for my elder sister**.
I love my elder sister very much, and she loves me too.


## Reference:

I always go to small shops. The clothes are beautiful. Small shops are always expensive, but there are a lot of sales. 
The sales assistants are always friendly. I never shop online. I never go to big department stores.

## Teacher comment:
Thank you for taking the time to finish the assignment on "Writing about shopping." 
You have managed to make good use of simple sentence structure and spelling. Good job! 
However, your submission had a few errors. In order to avoid them, please pay attention to my corrections below. 

- 1. I'd advise you to expand a little bit more on your vocabulary so that you avoid making phrasing issues such as, 
  "I'm a boy, so I less go to department stores." Which could have been phrased like this, 
  "I'm a boy, so I very seldom go to department stores." Note there are many ways to say the same thing, 
  just make sure it's grammatically correct. 
- 2. Remember if the article "a" precedes a word that starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o and u) it changes to "an". 
  For example, "But I have an elder sister." You did very good in this submission! 

I look forward to reading your next assignment. Please don't forget to use the online study tools found on the 
English online teaching website to further improve your writing skills. Regards, Lloyd.

## Summary

- 扩充词汇量也可以避免犯语法错误，I very seldom study new words. That is bad. I need to learn more new words.
- 以元音开头的单词（a,e,i,o,u，包括以这些发音开头的）用 an
