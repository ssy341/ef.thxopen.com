## My answer is:

Last year, I went to Emei mountain. There is a wonderful place like wonderland. There are some beautiful clouds and plants. There are also has many monkeys. And I am very lucky to see a squirrel. 
It so cute and smart. We are sightseeing on the mountain. It's amazing and exciting. Unfortunately, I put less clothes, I feel so cold. The mountain is too high to temperature is low. 
I'll put enough clothes next time.  As a whole, I enjoy this trip.

## Fix it

Last year, I went to Emei mountain. There is a wonderful place like **a** wonderland. There are some beautiful clouds and plants. **There are also many monkeys.** 
And I am very lucky to **have seen** a squirrel. It **was** so cute and smart. We **were** sightseeing on the mountain. It **was** amazing and exciting. 
Unfortunately, I put **on too few** clothes, I **felt** so cold. The mountain is too high **so the temperature is low**. I'll **put on** enough clothes next time. As a whole, I **enjoyed** this trip.

## Reference:

I absolutely love traveling. I've traveled to 11 countries. I've seen Anne Frank's house and Iguazu Falls. I've camped in Yosemite National Park, walked across the Tower Bridge, bought fancy clothes and taken an 
elephant tour.

I haven't been to Africa yet, but I really want to go. My trip last month to Thailand was difficult. The flight took 17 hours. When I arrived, customs took my cellphone, and I had to buy a new one!

## Teacher comment:

Please remember to check your verb tenses when you are writing. For example you said ‘And I am very lucky to see a squirrel.’ Rather say ‘And I am very lucky to have seen a squirrel.’
 
Please confirm your word choices so that you use the correct word in the correct circumstance. For instance you used the word ‘less‘ when you should have used the word ‘too few’.

## Summary

在描述过去已经发生的事情，时态很重要，可我经常犯这个错误，注意，**时态**
