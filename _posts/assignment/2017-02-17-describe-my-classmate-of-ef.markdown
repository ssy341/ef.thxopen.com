## My answer is:

I first met my classmate, Jason, when we were studying at EF center. 
That is my first class in EF. He already sat on the chair, he said hello to me when I walked in classroom. 
Then I said hello to him too and we started talking about our history together. 
Jason looks like very friendly and kind. He is taller than me. He told me he was a soldier before. 
Once a time, he got back hurts and he had to retire to get body well. I was so glad to meet him, he's a good friend.

## Fix it

No have

## Reference:

I first met my colleague, Jamie, when I was getting coffee at the office eight years ago. 
She was putting five spoons of sugar in her cup when I walked into the coffee room. 
When I saw that, I really liked her. She has gorgeous red hair and a funny laugh, like a little mouse. 
She has lived in 12 countries; Tanzania was the most interesting. Jamie and I enjoy working on projects together. 
We won $1,000 last year from our company for best design idea. Jamie is my colleague, but now she's also my old friend.
