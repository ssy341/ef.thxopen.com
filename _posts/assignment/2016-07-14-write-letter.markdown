## Reference:

June 10

Dear Dad and Mom,

How are you both? Lviv, Ukraine, was really cool. I took a tour so that I could understand the history of the gorgeous buildings. 
When I left Lviv, I learned that few people speak English. In order to eat and find hotels, I'm speaking some Ukrainian and smiling a lot!

Love,
Martyn

## Teacher comment:

1. Please focus on the pronouns. Pronouns take the place of nouns when referring to people, places or things.....
Hence, you should have used..."I live in my elder-sister's house" and not..." I live in elder-sister's house." 

2. Please focus on the prepositions. A preposition is a word placed before a noun or a pronoun to show in what relation the person or 
thing denoted by it stands in regard to something else. Hence, you should have used..."They took me to go sightseeing to a lot of places" and not..."They took me to go sightseeing for a lot of place."

## Summary

- 注意代词使用，代词代替名词时，☞的是人，地方或者物
