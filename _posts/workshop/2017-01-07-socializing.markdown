- Jane: Hi. Yeah everything's pretty good, thanks. How about you?
- William: Yeah, things are fine. I was just wondering; do you want to go out for dinner tomorrow?
- Jane: Tomorrow? Sorry, I can't. I'm going to the cinema with some friends. How about Wednesday?

- Jane: Yeah, Friday's fine. What time are you thinking?
- William: How does 6pm sound?
- Jane: That's a bit too early for me. I usually don't finish work until after 6. Is 7 OK?
- William: Sure, 7 is fine. Shall we meet at the curry mile, have some Indian food?
- Jane: Actually, I ate there last week, can we go for something different? There's a new Italian restaurant near my office I've been meaning to try. What do you think?
- William: Sure, why not?
- Jane: Ok, great. So I'll see you outside my office building, 7pm on Friday?
- William: Yep, see you there at 7.
- Jane: See you.

 - Ok, great. So I'll see you outside **my office building（place）**, **7pm(time)** on **Friday(day)**?
